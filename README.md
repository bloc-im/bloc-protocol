# Bloc Protocol

A vouch is a public message attesting to anything. 
Bloc is a network of members who vouch for each other. 

## Use Cases

#### Endorcements

A vouch can be from one address to another. It is one directional, with a public message attached. You can vouch for anyone, by writing something publicly.

#### Audits

An auditor could have a public address that vouches for smart contract addresses. Users can verify that contracts have been audited, and which addresses were covered in the audit.

#### Claims

A vouch can be from one address about itself. This can be used for recording general attestations, or to verify information.
